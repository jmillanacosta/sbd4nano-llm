       " - Surface functionalization of graphene oxide (GO) significantly impacts its interaction with cells. Unmodified GO in serum absorbs a large amount of protein molecules, which can promote macrophage phagocytosis. However, surface-modified GO (GO-NH 2, GO-PAA, GO-PEG) significantly reduces protein adsorption and interaction with macrophages. The surface properties of GO can also affect its interaction with the cell membrane. Surface modifications can increase or decrease the interaction of GO with the cell membrane. For instance, PEG and PAA modifications can effectively reduce membrane abnormalities, membrane integrity damage, and membrane potential depolarization caused by GO. (\"Surface Chemical Modifications of Graphene Oxide and Interaction Mechanisms at the Nano-Bio Interface\" pages 7-8)\n",
       "  \n",
       "- The primary mechanism of Au-GO (gold-graphene oxide) uptake is clathrin-mediated endocytosis, which is energy-dependent. The same experiment was conducted with GO (graphene oxide) alone, and the results were consistent, indicating that the presence of gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) did not alter the cellular uptake mechanism. (\"Mechanism of Cellular Uptake of Graphene Oxide Studied by Surface-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy\" pages 6-6)\n",
       "\n",
       "- The surface of GO can be chemically modified to regulate its properties and design specific functionalities. The oxygen-containing functional groups on the surface of GO can be used to control its surface chemistry. These modifications can improve its dispersion, colloidal stability, and biocompatibility under physiological conditions. (\"Surface Chemical Modifications of Graphene Oxide and Interaction Mechanisms at the Nano-Bio Interface\" pages 1-2)\n",
       "\n",
       "- The size of GO sheets affected their internalization by different cell types, with only two types of phagocytes capable of internalizing GO. The study also found that GO sheets of different sizes (2mm and 350 nm) were equally taken up by macrophages, suggesting that size does not affect uptake. The study also found that micro-sized GO induced stronger inflammation responses than nano-sized GO.

Our TEM observations, flow cytometric quantification,and inhibition assay results collectively showed that protein-coated small nanosheets enter cells through CME, while largenanosheets use both CME and phagocytosis. Because there isstill no detailed description of cellular uptake mechanisms oftwo-dimensional nanosheets, we propose a working model forthe cellular uptake of large and small PCGOs (Figure 6). Forlarge PCGO, the nanosheets first attach onto cell surfacefollowed by membrane invagination and extending ofpseudopodia and are subsequently engulfed into phagosome.For small PCGO, the nanosheets attach onto cell surfacefollowed by formation of clathrin-coated pits and are\n",
       "subsequently engulfed into endosome. All nanosheets enter\n",
       "lysosomes for excretion. The cellular uptake properties ofdifferent sizes of PCGO provide insight into the bioactivity ofthese nanostructures that can be used in designing biomedicaldevices. Large nanosheets may preferentially translocate intothe reticuloendothelial system, and small nanosheets arecapable of being distributed in various organs. The in vitroand in vivo activity of GO nanosheets may be regulatable bycontrolling their size. Such hypothesis is consistent with recentstudies.\n",
