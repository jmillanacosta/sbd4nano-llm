       " - Surface functionalization of graphene oxide (GO) significantly impacts its interaction with cells. Unmodified GO in serum absorbs a large amount of protein molecules, which can promote macrophage phagocytosis. However, surface-modified GO (GO-NH 2, GO-PAA, GO-PEG) significantly reduces protein adsorption and interaction with macrophages. The surface properties of GO can also affect its interaction with the cell membrane. Surface modifications can increase or decrease the interaction of GO with the cell membrane. For instance, PEG and PAA modifications can effectively reduce membrane abnormalities, membrane integrity damage, and membrane potential depolarization caused by GO.

The same experiment was conducted with GO (graphene oxide) alone, and the results were consistent, indicating that the presence of gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) did not alter the cellular uptake mechanism. (\"Mechanism of Cellular Uptake of Graphene Oxide Studied by Surface-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy\" pages 6-6)\n",

       "- The surface of GO can be chemically modified to regulate its properties and design specific functionalities. The oxygen-containing functional groups on the surface of GO can be used to control its surface chemistry. These modifications can improve its dispersion, colloidal stability, and biocompatibility under physiological conditions. (\"Surface Chemical Modifications of Graphene Oxide and Interaction Mechanisms at the Nano-Bio Interface\" pages 1-2)\n",

       "- The size of GO sheets affected their internalization by different cell types, with only two types of phagocytes capable of internalizing GO. The study also found that GO sheets of different sizes (2mm and 350 nm) were equally taken up by macrophages, suggesting that size does not affect uptake. The study also found that micro-sized GO induced stronger inflammation responses than nano-sized GO.
