However, little information of their toxicity and biocompatibility is available. Herein, we performed a comprehensive study on the toxicity of graphene oxide (GO) by examining the influences of GO on the morphology, viability, mortality and membrane integrity of A549 cells. The results suggest that GO does not enter A549 cell and has no obvious cytotoxicity. But GO can cause a dose-dependent oxidative stress in cell and induce a slight loss of cell viability at high concentration. These effects are dose and size related, and should be considered in the development of bio-applications of GO.

In contrast, GO had\\nthicknesses ranging from 0.5 to 2.0 nm and areas up to200 000 nm2.

In lung sections from\\nanimals treated with Pluronic-dispersed graphene, we observedlung macrophages with a homogeneous black cytoplasm\\nthroughout the lung, which were not observed in vehicle treated\\nanimals (Figure 2a /C0e). In mice treated with graphene aggregates\\nsuspended in saline, we observed the aggregates in medium sized\\nairways surrounded by macrophages with a homogeneous black\\ncytoplasm (Figure 2a /C0e). To quantify the di ï¬erences in the\\ndistribution of the dispersed and aggregated graphene in thelung, we counted the number of randomly chosen 600 /C2ï¬elds\\ncontaining macrophages with black cytoplasm.

Despite the long-term retention of i.p. injected GO and PEGylated GO in the mouse body, no significant toxicity was noticed in our systematic serum biochemistry, complete blood panel test, and histological analysis. The formation of granulomas, which could be induced by i.p. injected long MWNTs, was not observed in mice injected with high dose of GO or PEGylated GO.

TOXICITY MECHANISMS\\nAlthough the mechanisms responsible for graphene and GOtoxicity have been discussed previously,51no conclusions have\\nbeen drawn that are su ï¬cient to establish risk assessments or\\nregulations.89Graphene is a unique nanomaterial compared withspherical nanoparticles and one-dimensional nanotubes due to\\nits two-dimensional structure.\\nMany reports have proposed that oxidative stress is one\\nof the mechanisms involved in the toxic e ï¬ects of carbon nano-\\nmaterials.2,24,37,90The oxidative stress in target cells is caused by\\nthe generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS).2Antioxidant\\nenzymes, such as superoxide dismutase or glutathione per-oxidase, are able to reduce and eliminate ROS. If homeostasis isnot achieved, cellular macromolecules, such as proteins, DNA,and lipids, can be damaged.\\n2\\nCell membrane damage through physical interaction with\\ngraphenes possessing sharp edges is another possible mechanismof toxicity.68,73Furthermore, due to its hydrophobic surface,\\ngraphene can signi ï¬cantly interact with cell membrane lipids,\\ncausing toxicity.2\\nBacterial cells interacting with GO and rGO exhibited toxicity,\\nwhich may be due to the loss of membrane integrity, and theproposed toxicity mechanism includes initial cell deposition ongraphene-based materials and membrane stress caused by directcontact with sharp nanosheets.\\n17Gurunathan et al.90previously\\ndem', name='Seabra2013 pages 6-6', doc=Doc(docname='Seabra2013', citation='Seabra, Amedea B., et al. \"Nanotoxicity of Graphene and Graphene Oxide.\" ACS Nano, vol. 7, no. 10, 2013, pp. 8191-8207.', dockey='51e13c001756189cac875d9e59a3ca22'), embeddings=None) score=10\n",

The Fe/H11002Co/MgO cata-\\nlyst system with a stoichiometric composition of 2.5:2.5:95 wt %was prepared by the impregnation method as previouslyshown.\\n9Few-layer graphene sheets were grown by radio fre-\\nquency catalytic chemical vapor deposition (RF-cCVD) on a MgO-supported Fe /H11002Co bimetallic catalyst system utilizing acetylene\\nas a hydrocarbon source. Approximately 100 mg of the catalystwas uniformly spread into a thin layer on a graphite susceptorand placed in the center of a quartz tube with an inner diam-eter of 1 in. First, the tube was purged with a carrier gas (argon)for 10 min at 150 mL/min. Next, the RF generator (which pro-vides a very fast heating rate of 300 /H11002350 Â°C/min) was turned on\\nto begin heating. When the temperature of the graphite boatreached 1000 Â°C, acetylene was introduced at 4.5 mL/min for 30min. At the end of the reaction, the system was cooled under ar-\\ngon for 10 min. The as-produced G sheets were puriï¬ed in oneeasy step using diluted hydrochloric acid solution and sonica-tion. Graphene sheets were thoroughly characterized by micros-copy, spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction.\\nSWNT Synthesis. Carbon nanotubes were synthesized over the\\nFe/H11002Co/MgO catalyst using the RF-cCVD method and methaneas the carbon source.\\n31The RF inductive heating was performed\\nusing an RF generator operated at 365 kHz. A 200 mg quantityof catalyst was placed in a graphite boat, and the boat was in-serted into a quartz reactor. The catalysts were heated in nitro-gen (ï¬ow rate 600 mL/min) and annealed at 700 Â°C for 1 h. All ofthe synthesis reactions were performed at 850 Â°C with a meth-ane ï¬ow rate of 80 mL/min, while keeping the nitrogen ï¬ow con-\\nstant. The temperature of the graphite boat was continuouslymeasured by an optical pyrometer and was found to be verystable during the reaction process. After 30 min of reaction time,the methane was turned off, and the resulting product was al-lowed to cool in nitrogen ï¬ow. The as-produced SWNTs were pu-riï¬ed using hydrochloric acid solution. Their diameters werefound to range between 0.8 and 1.2 nm, as previouslyshown.\\n31\\nTEM images were collected on a ï¬eld emission JEM-2100F\\ntransmission electron microscopy (JEOL Inc.) equipped with aCCD camera. The acceleration voltage was 100 kV for the Ganalysis. The G nanosheets and the nanotube samples were ho-mogeneously dispersed in 2-propanol under ultrasonication for30 min.
