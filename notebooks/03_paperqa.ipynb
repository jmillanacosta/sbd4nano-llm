However, little information of their toxicity and biocompatibility is available. Herein, we performed a comprehensive study on the toxicity of graphene oxide (GO) by examining the influences of GO on the morphology, viability, mortality and membrane integrity of A549 cells. The results suggest that GO does not enter A549 cell and has no obvious cytotoxicity. But GO can cause a dose-dependent oxidative stress in cell and induce a slight loss of cell viability at high concentration. These effects are dose and size related, and should be considered in the development of bio-applications of GO.

TOXICITY MECHANISMS\\nAlthough the mechanisms responsible for graphene and GOtoxicity have been discussed previously,51no conclusions have\\nbeen drawn that are su ﬃcient to establish risk assessments or\\nregulations.89Graphene is a unique nanomaterial compared withspherical nanoparticles and one-dimensional nanotubes due to\\nits two-dimensional structure.\\nMany reports have proposed that oxidative stress is one\\nof the mechanisms involved in the toxic e ﬀects of carbon nano-\\nmaterials.2,24,37,90The oxidative stress in target cells is caused by\\nthe generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS).2Antioxidant\\nenzymes, such as superoxide dismutase or glutathione per-oxidase, are able to reduce and eliminate ROS. If homeostasis isnot achieved, cellular macromolecules, such as proteins, DNA,and lipids, can be damaged.\\n2\\nCell membrane damage through physical interaction with\\ngraphenes possessing sharp edges is another possible mechanismof toxicity.68,73Furthermore, due to its hydrophobic surface,\\ngraphene can signi ﬁcantly interact with cell membrane lipids,\\ncausing toxicity.2\\nBacterial cells interacting with GO and rGO exhibited toxicity,\\nwhich may be due to the loss of membrane integrity, and theproposed toxicity mechanism includes initial cell deposition ongraphene-based materials and membrane stress caused by directcontact with sharp nanosheets.\\n17Gurunathan et al.90previously\\ndem', name='Seabra2013 pages 6-6', doc=Doc(docname='Seabra2013', citation='Seabra, Amedea B., et al. \"Nanotoxicity of Graphene and Graphene Oxide.\" ACS Nano, vol. 7, no. 10, 2013, pp. 8191-8207.', dockey='51e13c001756189cac875d9e59a3ca22'), embeddings=None) score=10\n",

A 200 mg quantityof catalyst was placed in a graphite boat, and the boat was in-serted into a quartz reactor. The catalysts were heated in nitro-gen (ﬂow rate 600 mL/min) and annealed at 700 °C for 1 h. All ofthe synthesis reactions were performed at 850 °C with a meth-ane ﬂow rate of 80 mL/min, while keeping the nitrogen ﬂow con-\\nstant. The temperature of the graphite boat was continuouslymeasured by an optical pyrometer and was found to be verystable during the reaction process. After 30 min of reaction time,the methane was turned off, and the resulting product was al-lowed to cool in nitrogen ﬂow. The as-produced SWNTs were pu-riﬁed using hydrochloric acid solution. Their diameters werefound to range between 0.8 and 1.2 nm, as previouslyshown.\\n31\\nTEM images were collected on a ﬁeld emission JEM-2100F\\ntransmission electron microscopy (JEOL Inc.) equipped with aCCD camera. The acceleration voltage was 100 kV for the Ganalysis. The G nanosheets and the nanotube samples were ho-mogeneously dispersed in 2-propanol under ultrasonication for30 min. Next, a few drops of the suspension were deposited onthe TEM grid, dried, and evacuated before analysis.\\nFigure 4.

Graphene (G) has be-come one of the most intensively studiedsuch nanomaterials for a number of applica-tions. Studies focus on taking advantage of\\nits chemical, physical, and other propertiesin order to develop novel applications withadvanced scientiﬁc and commercialpotential.\\n1/H110024However, the biological appli-\\ncations and potential adverse effects of Gremain almost completely unknown. Re-cently, G or graphite oxides sheets have re-ceived signiﬁcant attention for their poten-tial application in biology and medicine,including biodevices, microbial detection,disease diagnosis,\\n5and drug delivery sys-\\ntems.6A key issue that needs to be investi-\\ngated in the full implementation of such na-nomaterials in a large range of biologicalapplications and processes is their relativelyunknown cytotoxicity and biological activ-ity. Such studies would provide insight intothe interaction between atomically ﬂat gra-phitic structures and various biological sys-tems both in vitro and in vivo . The cytotoxic\\neffects of G are expected to be signiﬁcantlydifferent when compared to those of one-dimensional CNT, which have been widelystudied.\\n7,8Although the two materials have\\na similar chemical composition and crystal-line structure, their shape is different (ﬂatatomic sheets for G and tubular for nano-tubes); as a result, their interactions with cellsystems are expected to be governed bydifferent mechanisms. Given the high po-\\ntential of G structures to be used as deliv-ery vehicles for growth factors and otherproteins for neural reconstruction and re-generation of the nervous system (which isessential in the treatment of Alzheimer’sdisease), it is crucial to fully study and un-derstand the interaction and the bioreactiv-ity of such nanomaterials when exposed toneuronal cells. This article presents anevaluation of the in vitro toxicity of G by us-\\ning neuronal PC12 cells compared to single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) in similarconditions. A clear difference in the toxiclevels between G and SWCNT is indicated.To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrststudy to address this issue.\\nG AND SWCNT SYNTHESIS\\nHigh quantities of few-layer G sheets\\nwere successfully synthesized on theFe/H11002Co/MgO', name='Zhang3900 pages 1-1', doc=Doc(docname='Zhang3900', citation='Zhang, Yongbin, et al. \"Cytotoxicity Effects of Graphene and Single-Wall Carbon Nanotubes in Neural Phaeochromocytoma-Derived PC12 Cells.\" Neurochemistry Laboratory, Division of Neurotoxicology, National Center for Toxicological Research, Food and Drug Administration, 3900 NCTR Road, Jefferson, Arkansas 72079 and Nanotechnology Center, Applied Science Department, University of Arkansas at Little Rock, 2801 South University Avenue, Little Rock, Arkansas 72204. 07/05/2023.', dockey='9475f501936e416ee6e948240bbed50d'), embeddings=None) score=5\n",

The GOs were treated with strong acid and then purified to a great extent prior to use. No metal contaminations were observed for the GOs, and the impurities included 2&#x02013;3% of sulfur and &#x0003c;1% of nitrogen. The oxygen contents for the untreated 45-min-sonicated, and 2.5-h-sonicated GOs were the same, which was 36.1 &#x000b1; 0.1 %, while the UV-treated and thermally reduced GOs, with oxygen contents of 35 &#x000b1; 0.7 % and 33.9 &#x000b1; 0.1 %, respectively, had a lower oxygen than untreated GO.

       "The study by Ruiz (2011) found that graphene oxide (GO) concentrations of 25 μg and 75 μg led to the outcome of promoting bacterial growth. Filters containing 25 μg of GO had double the amount of bacteria compared to filters without GO, while filters covered with 75 μg of GO had three times more cells than the neat filter. The study observed that areas with higher GO content on the filters had large cell colonies that followed a lined pattern, indicating a preference of bacteria to attach and grow in areas containing GO. Therefore, the concentrations of 25 μg and 75 μg of GO were found to enhance microbial growth when coated onto another surface (Ruiz, 2011)."
