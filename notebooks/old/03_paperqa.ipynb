However, little information of their toxicity and biocompatibility is available. Herein, we performed a comprehensive study on the toxicity of graphene oxide (GO) by examining the influences of GO on the morphology, viability, mortality and membrane integrity of A549 cells. The results suggest that GO does not enter A549 cell and has no obvious cytotoxicity. But GO can cause a dose-dependent oxidative stress in cell and induce a slight loss of cell viability at high concentration. These effects are dose and size related, and should be considered in the development of bio-applications of GO.

The Fe/H11002Co/MgO cata-\\nlyst system with a stoichiometric composition of 2.5:2.5:95 wt %was prepared by the impregnation method as previouslyshown.\\n9Few-layer graphene sheets were grown by radio fre-\\nquency catalytic chemical vapor deposition (RF-cCVD) on a MgO-supported Fe /H11002Co bimetallic catalyst system utilizing acetylene\\nas a hydrocarbon source. Approximately 100 mg of the catalystwas uniformly spread into a thin layer on a graphite susceptorand placed in the center of a quartz tube with an inner diam-eter of 1 in. First, the tube was purged with a carrier gas (argon)for 10 min at 150 mL/min. Next, the RF generator (which pro-vides a very fast heating rate of 300 /H11002350 Â°C/min) was turned on\\nto begin heating. When the temperature of the graphite boatreached 1000 Â°C, acetylene was introduced at 4.5 mL/min for 30min. At the end of the reaction, the system was cooled under ar-\\ngon for 10 min. The as-produced G sheets were puriï¬ed in oneeasy step using diluted hydrochloric acid solution and sonica-tion. Graphene sheets were thoroughly characterized by micros-copy, spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction.\\nSWNT Synthesis. Carbon nanotubes were synthesized over the\\nFe/H11002Co/MgO catalyst using the RF-cCVD method and methaneas the carbon source.\\n31The RF inductive heating was performed\\nusing an RF generator operated at 365 kHz. A 200 mg quantityof catalyst was placed in a graphite boat, and the boat was in-serted into a quartz reactor. The catalysts were heated in nitro-gen (ï¬ow rate 600 mL/min) and annealed at 700 Â°C for 1 h. All ofthe synthesis reactions were performed at 850 Â°C with a meth-ane ï¬ow rate of 80 mL/min, while keeping the nitrogen ï¬ow con-\\nstant. The temperature of the graphite boat was continuouslymeasured by an optical pyrometer and was found to be verystable during the reaction process. After 30 min of reaction time,the methane was turned off, and the resulting product was al-lowed to cool in nitrogen ï¬ow. The as-produced SWNTs were pu-riï¬ed using hydrochloric acid solution. Their diameters werefound to range between 0.8 and 1.2 nm, as previouslyshown.\\n31\\nTEM images were collected on a ï¬eld emission JEM-2100F\\ntransmission electron microscopy (JEOL Inc.) equipped with aCCD camera. The acceleration voltage was 100 kV for the Ganalysis. The G nanosheets and the nanotube samples were ho-mogeneously dispersed in 2-propanol under ultrasonication for30 min. Next, a few drops of the suspension were deposited onthe TEM grid, dried, and evacuated before analysis.\\nFigure 4.

The dis-\\npersed graphene was found to have a thickness ranging from 1.2\\nto 5.0 nm with areas up to 40 000 nm2. In contrast, GO had\\nthicknesses ranging from 0.5 to 2.0 nm and areas up to200 000 nm2. However, in both cases more than 90% of the\\nflakes had areas less than 25 000 nm2.\\nGross examination of para ï¬n embedded lung blocks from\\nmice treated 24 h earlier showed a more homogeneous distribu-tion pattern in mice treated with the Pluronic dispersed graphene\\ncompared with the aggregated graphene. In lung sections from\\nanimals treated with Pluronic-dispersed graphene, we observedlung macrophages with a homogeneous black cytoplasm\\nthroughout the lung, which were not observed in vehicle treated\\nanimals (Figure 2a /C0e). In mice treated with graphene aggregates\\nsuspended in saline, we observed the aggregates in medium sized\\nairways surrounded by macrophages with a homogeneous black\\ncytoplasm (Figure 2a /C0e). To quantify the di ï¬erences in the\\ndistribution of the dispersed and aggregated graphene in thelung, we counted the number of randomly chosen 600 /C2ï¬elds\\ncontaining macrophages with black cytoplasm. In mice treated\\nwith nanoscale dispersed graphene, 91 (4% of the high powered\\n(600/C2)ï¬elds contained macrophages with a black cytoplasm\\ncompared with 36 (1% in the mice treated with graphene\\naggregates.

In marked contrast, we ob-\\nserved severe lung in ï¬ammation with alveolar exudates and hyaline\\nmembrane formation in mice treated with GO (Figure 2a /C0e). The\\nlung injury induced by GO treated mice was evident in low power\\nelectron micrographs (Figure 2f) and was accompanied by a\\nleakage of protein into the alveolar space, BAL ï¬uid pleiocytosis,\\nand elevated BAL levels of pro-in ï¬ammatory cytokines\\n(Figure 2g /C0k).

If homeostasis isnot achieved, cellular macromolecules, such as proteins, DNA,and lipids, can be damaged.\\n2\\nCell membrane damage through physical interaction with\\ngraphenes possessing sharp edges is another possible mechanismof toxicity.68,73Furthermore, due to its hydrophobic surface,\\ngraphene can signi ï¬cantly interact with cell membrane lipids,\\ncausing toxicity.2\\nBacterial cells interacting with GO and rGO exhibited toxicity,\\nwhich may be due to the loss of membrane integrity, and theproposed toxicity mechanism includes initial cell deposition ongraphene-based materials and membrane stress caused by directcontact with sharp nanosheets.\\n17Gurunathan et al.90previously\\ndem', name='Seabra2013 pages 6-6', doc=Doc(docname='Seabra2013', citation='Seabra, Amedea B., et al. \"Nanotoxicity of Graphene and Graphene Oxide.\" ACS Nano, vol. 7, no. 10, 2013, pp. 8191-8207.', dockey='51e13c001756189cac875d9e59a3ca22'), embeddings=None) score=10\n",

Graphene (G) has be-come one of the most intensively studiedsuch nanomaterials for a number of applica-tions. Studies focus on taking advantage of\\nits chemical, physical, and other propertiesin order to develop novel applications withadvanced scientiï¬c and commercialpotential.\\n1/H110024However, the biological appli-\\ncations and potential adverse effects of Gremain almost completely unknown. Re-cently, G or graphite oxides sheets have re-ceived signiï¬cant attention for their poten-tial application in biology and medicine,including biodevices, microbial detection,disease diagnosis,\\n5and drug delivery sys-\\ntems.6A key issue that needs to be investi-\\ngated in the full implementation of such na-nomaterials in a large range of biologicalapplications and processes is their relativelyunknown cytotoxicity and biological activ-ity. Such studies would provide insight intothe interaction between atomically ï¬at gra-phitic structures and various biological sys-tems both in vitro and in vivo . The cytotoxic\\neffects of G are expected to be signiï¬cantlydifferent when compared to those of one-dimensional CNT, which have been widelystudied.\\n7,8Although the two materials have\\na similar chemical composition and crystal-line structure, their shape is different (ï¬atatomic sheets for G and tubular for nano-tubes); as a result, their interactions with cellsystems are expected to be governed bydifferent mechanisms. Given the high po-\\ntential of G structures to be used as deliv-ery vehicles for growth factors and otherproteins for neural reconstruction and re-generation of the nervous system (which isessential in the treatment of Alzheimerâsdisease), it is crucial to fully study and un-derstand the interaction and the bioreactiv-ity of such nanomaterials when exposed toneuronal cells. This article presents anevaluation of the in vitro toxicity of G by us-\\ning neuronal PC12 cells compared to single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) in similarconditions. A clear difference in the toxiclevels between G and SWCNT is indicated.To the best of our knowledge, this is the ï¬rststudy to address this issue.\\nG AND SWCNT SYNTHESIS\\nHigh quantities of few-layer G sheets\\nwere successfully synthesized on theFe/H11002Co/MgO', name='Zhang3900 pages 1-1', doc=Doc(docname='Zhang3900', citation='Zhang, Yongbin, et al. \"Cytotoxicity Effects of Graphene and Single-Wall Carbon Nanotubes in Neural Phaeochromocytoma-Derived PC12 Cells.\" Neurochemistry Laboratory, Division of Neurotoxicology, National Center for Toxicological Research, Food and Drug Administration, 3900 NCTR Road, Jefferson, Arkansas 72079 and Nanotechnology Center, Applied Science Department, University of Arkansas at Little Rock, 2801 South University Avenue, Little Rock, Arkansas 72204. 07/05/2023.', dockey='9475f501936e416ee6e948240bbed50d'), embeddings=None) score=7\n",

The GOs were treated with strong acid and then purified to a great extent prior to use. No metal contaminations were observed for the GOs, and the impurities included 2&#x02013;3% of sulfur and &#x0003c;1% of nitrogen. The oxygen contents for the untreated 45-min-sonicated, and 2.5-h-sonicated GOs were the same, which was 36.1 &#x000b1; 0.1 %, while the UV-treated and thermally reduced GOs, with oxygen contents of 35 &#x000b1; 0.7 % and 33.9 &#x000b1; 0.1 %, respectively, had a lower oxygen than untreated GO. It is worth noting that the oxygen content of thermally reduced GO was significantly lower (<italic toggle=\"yes\">p</italic> = 0.0001) than that of the untreated control GO, while the difference between the untreated control and the UV-treated GOs was not significant (<italic toggle=\"yes\">p</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05). Correspondingly, the O/C ratio had the same trend for all five samples. The impurities and the monolayer content were the same for all five samples.</p><p>GO mainly consists of carbon and oxygen species bonded to carbon, e.g., the epoxy, hydroxyl, and carboxylic groups. Because of its complex nonstoichiometric nature, the contents for each species may vary significantly. In our study, untreated thermally reduced and sonicated samples have similar carbon-carbon, epoxy, hydroxyl, and carboxylic groups. In contrast, for the UV-treated sample, the carbon-carbon groups are significantly higher than for the untreated GO, while the epoxy and hydroxyl groups are significantly lower than for the untreated one.</p><p>Zeta potential is an important characteristic indicating the stability of colloidal dispersions. The low zeta potential values for the five samples, ranging from &#x02212;5.53 &#x000b1; 0.36 mV to &#x02212;7.39 &#x000b1; 0.56 mV, means a low stability of GOs in the SD medium. Moreover, the UV-treated and thermally reduced GOs have lower zeta potential than the other three, indicating that the former two samples are more inclined to aggregate in the SD medium. However, after adding the dispersant (1% BSA), the aggregation was quite slight, indicated by the similar aggregation size determined by the DLS of GOs pr', name='Dependence2021 lines 6-7', doc=Doc(docname='Dependence2021', citation='\"Dependence of Graphene Oxide (GO) Toxicity on Oxidation Level, Elemental Composition, and Size.\" International Journal of Molecular Sciences, vol. 22, no. 19, 2021, article 10578.

Furthermore, peroxidative damage, indicated by elevated levels of lipid peroxidation (LPO), was only found in samples treated with the highest GO concentration (50 mg/L) for â¥48 hours (Lv2018 lines 1123-1127).

The specific mechanism of uptake can be influenced by the material's properties, such as the surface charge and particle size of GO (Matesanz2013). GO has carboxylate groups on the periphery that provide a negative surface charge, which can interact with cell membranes and facilitate endocytosis (Matesanz2013). The surface charge and particle size of GO can also determine its intracellular localization (Matesanz2013).

GO is produced by exfoliating graphite oxide and has various chemical and electronic properties. The oxygen-derived functional groups on the GO sheet allow it to react with organic and inorganic chemicals, leading to the synthesis of functional hybrids and complexes. The coverage of oxygen groups on GO varies depending on the degree of oxidation. The most widely accepted structural model of GO suggests that the functional groups on the basal plane consist primarily of hydroxyl and epoxy groups, with only small quantities of carboxyl groups at the edge. Recent experiments suggest that the peripheral carboxyl groups play a key role in determining the solution behavior of GO. The pH-dependent hydrophilicity of GO is attributed to the ionized carboxyl groups. \\\\n\\\\nRelevance score: 10/10\\\\n\\\\nYang2013 lines 0-1: The text discusses a study on the in vivo biodistribution and toxicology of functionalized nano-graphene oxide (GO) in mice after oral and intraperitoneal administration.

INTRODUCTION\\\\nIn recent years, as an alternative approach to producing\\\\ngraphene on a large scale,1/C03the exfoliation of graphite oxide\\\\nhas triggered considerable research e \\\\ufb00orts aimed at demonstrat-\\\\ning its chemical and electronic properties.4,5The resulting thin\\\\ngraphene oxide (GO) sheets can be easily dispersed in an\\\\naqueous medium without adding amphiphilic stabilizers, includ-ing subsequently carrying out the necessary solution-phasechemistry. The oxygen-derived functional groups on the sheet\\\\nbasal plane and sheet edge allows GO to be reactive with organic\\\\nand inorganic chemicals such that a rich variety of functionalhybrids and complexes can be synthesized.\\\\n4,5In addition, the\\\\nmolecular orbital change of sp3to sp2carbons through reduction\\\\nchemistry can restore the graphene lattice to some extent.6,7\\\\nFurthermore, the tunable conductivity and electronic band gap\\\\nprovide a controllable route to transforming an insulator to a\\\\ngraphenelike semimetal.5Because of these interesting GO prop-\\\\nerties, a broad spectrum of potential applications ranging fromprintable electronics and solar cells to biosensors have been\\\\nproposed. To control the processes of exfoliation, dispersion,\\\\nfunctionalization, and self-assembly8of the suspended GO sheets\\\\nin aqueous media, a fundamental understanding of their solution\\\\nbehavior is in order.4\\\\nThe chemical structure of GO is heterogeneous, and the\\\\ncoverage of oxygen groups varies depending on the degree of\\\\noxidation in the preparation processes.4To date, the most widely\\\\naccepted structural model of GO is based on a series of analysesperformed by Lerf and Klinowski.9These analyses indicated that\\\\nthe functional groups on the basal plane of the GO sheet consistsprimarily of hydroxyl and epoxy groups and that only small\\\\nquantities of carboxyl groups are present at the edge of the GO\\\\nsheets.9Considering the excellent ability of water to disperse\\\\nGO, this material was initially assumed to be hydrophilic, withthe hydrophilicity resulting from the hydroxyl and epoxy groupspresent in the GO sheet basal plane.\\\\n1However, recent experi-\\\\nments involving pH changes and salt addition suggest that the\\\\nperipheral carboxyl groups actually play a key role in determiningthe solution behavior of GO.10The colloidal stability of aqueous\\\\nGO solutions has been attributed to the electrostatic repulsions\\\\nbetween ionized carboxyl groups.10The pH-dependent hydro-\\\\nphilicity of GO has been exploited to c\", \"name\": \"Shih2012 pages 1-1\", \"doc\": {\"docname\": \"Shih2012\", \"citation\": \"Shih, Chih-Jen, et al. \\\\\"Understanding the pH-Dependent Behavior of Graphene Oxide Aqueous Solutions: A Comparative Experimental and Molecular Dynamics Simulation Study.\\\\\" Langmuir, vol. 28, 2012, pp. 235-241. doi:10.1021/la203607w.\", \"dockey\": \"66563f51f3bdb59e38fa9916ff4e7172\"}, \"embeddings\": null}, \"score\": 10}, {\"context\": \"The text discusses a study on the in vivo biodistribution and toxicology of functionalized nano-graphene oxide (GO) in mice after oral and intraperitoneal administration.

However, the biological behavior of these nanosheets,especially their interactions with cells, is not well understood.

Small nanosheets enter cellsmainly through clathrin-mediated endocytosis, and the increase ofgraphene size enhances phagocytotic uptake of the nanosheets.

INTRODUCTION\\nIn recent years, as an alternative approach to producing\\ngraphene on a large scale,1/C03the exfoliation of graphite oxide\\nhas triggered considerable research e ï¬orts aimed at demonstrat-\\ning its chemical and electronic properties.4,5The resulting thin\\ngraphene oxide (GO) sheets can be easily dispersed in an\\naqueous medium without adding amphiphilic stabilizers, includ-ing subsequently carrying out the necessary solution-phasechemistry. The oxygen-derived functional groups on the sheet\\nbasal plane and sheet edge allows GO to be reactive with organic\\nand inorganic chemicals such that a rich variety of functionalhybrids and complexes can be synthesized.\\n4,5In addition, the\\nmolecular orbital change of sp3to sp2carbons through reduction\\nchemistry can restore the graphene lattice to some extent.6,7\\nFurthermore, the tunable conductivity and electronic band gap\\nprovide a controllable route to transforming an insulator to a\\ngraphenelike semimetal.5Because of these interesting GO prop-\\nerties, a broad spectrum of potential applications ranging fromprintable electronics and solar cells to biosensors have been\\nproposed. To control the processes of exfoliation, dispersion,\\nfunctionalization, and self-assembly8of the suspended GO sheets\\nin aqueous media, a fundamental understanding of their solution\\nbehavior is in order.4\\nThe chemical structure of GO is heterogeneous, and the\\ncoverage of oxygen groups varies depending on the degree of\\noxidation in the preparation processes.4To date, the most widely\\naccepted structural model of GO is based on a series of analysesperformed by Lerf and Klinowski.9These analyses indicated that\\nthe functional groups on the basal plane of the GO sheet consistsprimarily of hydroxyl and epoxy groups and that only small\\nquantities of carboxyl groups are present at the edge of the GO\\nsheets.9Considering the excellent ability of water to disperse\\nGO, this material was initially assumed to be hydrophilic, withthe hydrophilicity resulting from the hydroxyl and epoxy groupspresent in the GO sheet basal plane.\\n1However, recent experi-\\nments involving pH changes and salt addition suggest that the\\nperipheral carboxyl groups actually play a key role in determiningthe solution behavior of GO.10The colloidal stability of aqueous\\nGO solutions has been attributed to the electrostatic repulsions\\nbetween ionized carboxyl groups.10The pH-dependent hydro-\\nphilicity of GO has been exploited to c',\n",

These factsindicate that the potential toxic e ï¬ect of graphenes on plants may\\nlargely depend on the graphene dose, exposure time, and theplant species. Therefore, this topic deserves further attention.\\n86\\nTo assess physiological responses, such as biomass accumu-\\nlation, few-layer graphene materials were introduced intoMurashige and Skoog (MS) media (50 Î¼g/mL) along with\\ntomato seeds with a sterilized surface, and the germination andgrowth were followed.\\n87The authors observed that few-layer\\ngraphene carbon structures did not signi ï¬cantly a ï¬ect plant\\ngrowth rates, most likely because of their inability to penetrateplant tissues.\\nShort-term and high-load e ï¬ects of GO on microbial functions\\nrelated to biological wastewater treatment processes showedtoxic e ï¬ects on microbial communities in a dose-dependent\\nmanner, especially in concentrations greater than 50 mg/L.Many biological activities were signi ï¬cantly impacted by the\\npresence of GO in an activated sludge.

TOXICITY MECHANISMS\\nAlthough the mechanisms responsible for graphene and GOtoxicity have been discussed previously,51no conclusions have\\nbeen drawn that are su ï¬cient to establish risk assessments or\\nregulations.89Graphene is a unique nanomaterial compared withspherical nanoparticles and one-dimensional nanotubes due to\\nits two-dimensional structure.\\nMany reports have proposed that oxidative stress is one\\nof the mechanisms involved in the toxic e ï¬ects of carbon nano-\\nmaterials.2,24,37,90The oxidative stress in target cells is caused by\\nthe generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS).2Antioxidant\\nenzymes, such as superoxide dismutase or glutathione per-oxidase, are able to reduce and eliminate ROS. If homeostasis isnot achieved, cellular macromolecules, such as proteins, DNA,and lipids, can be damaged.\\n2\\nCell membrane damage through physical interaction with\\ngraphenes possessing sharp edges is another possible mechanismof toxicity.68,73Furthermore, due to its hydrophobic surface,\\ngraphene can signi ï¬cantly interact with cell membrane lipids,\\ncausing toxicity.2\\nBacterial cells interacting with GO and rGO exhibited toxicity,\\nwhich may be due to the loss of membrane integrity, and theproposed toxicity mechanism includes initial cell deposition ongraphene-based materials and membrane stress caused by directcontact with sharp nanosheets.\\n17Gurunathan et al.90previously\\ndem',\n",

       " 'formatted_answer': 'Question: How does surface functionalization affect the behavior of graphene oxide upon exposure?\\n\\nSurface functionalization of graphene oxide (GO) can significantly affect its behavior upon exposure. Different surface chemical modifications, such as oxidation, reduction, carboxylation, amination, and polymer modification, can alter the physicochemical properties of GO and its interaction with biological systems (Ma2020; Matesanz2013). Surface functionalization can affect the oxygen content, O/C ratio, zeta potential, and colloidal stability of GO, leading to changes in its aggregation behavior and biodistribution (Dependence2021; Yang2013). It can also influence the interaction mechanisms at the nano-bio interface, such as protein corona formation, cell membrane damage, membrane receptor interaction, and oxidative stress (Ma2020). Additionally, surface functionalization can impact the cytotoxicity, ROS generation, and conformational changes induced by GO exposure (An2023). Overall, surface functionalization plays a crucial role in modulating the behavior and biological effects of GO upon exposure.\\n',\n",
