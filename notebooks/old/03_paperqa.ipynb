However, little information of their toxicity and biocompatibility is available. Herein, we performed a comprehensive study on the toxicity of graphene oxide (GO) by examining the influences of GO on the morphology, viability, mortality and membrane integrity of A549 cells. The results suggest that GO does not enter A549 cell and has no obvious cytotoxicity. But GO can cause a dose-dependent oxidative stress in cell and induce a slight loss of cell viability at high concentration. These effects are dose and size related, and should be considered in the development of bio-applications of GO.

The Fe/H11002Co/MgO cata-\\nlyst system with a stoichiometric composition of 2.5:2.5:95 wt %was prepared by the impregnation method as previouslyshown.\\n9Few-layer graphene sheets were grown by radio fre-\\nquency catalytic chemical vapor deposition (RF-cCVD) on a MgO-supported Fe /H11002Co bimetallic catalyst system utilizing acetylene\\nas a hydrocarbon source. Approximately 100 mg of the catalystwas uniformly spread into a thin layer on a graphite susceptorand placed in the center of a quartz tube with an inner diam-eter of 1 in. First, the tube was purged with a carrier gas (argon)for 10 min at 150 mL/min. Next, the RF generator (which pro-vides a very fast heating rate of 300 /H11002350 °C/min) was turned on\\nto begin heating. When the temperature of the graphite boatreached 1000 °C, acetylene was introduced at 4.5 mL/min for 30min. At the end of the reaction, the system was cooled under ar-\\ngon for 10 min. The as-produced G sheets were puriﬁed in oneeasy step using diluted hydrochloric acid solution and sonica-tion. Graphene sheets were thoroughly characterized by micros-copy, spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction.\\nSWNT Synthesis. Carbon nanotubes were synthesized over the\\nFe/H11002Co/MgO catalyst using the RF-cCVD method and methaneas the carbon source.\\n31The RF inductive heating was performed\\nusing an RF generator operated at 365 kHz. A 200 mg quantityof catalyst was placed in a graphite boat, and the boat was in-serted into a quartz reactor. The catalysts were heated in nitro-gen (ﬂow rate 600 mL/min) and annealed at 700 °C for 1 h. All ofthe synthesis reactions were performed at 850 °C with a meth-ane ﬂow rate of 80 mL/min, while keeping the nitrogen ﬂow con-\\nstant. The temperature of the graphite boat was continuouslymeasured by an optical pyrometer and was found to be verystable during the reaction process. After 30 min of reaction time,the methane was turned off, and the resulting product was al-lowed to cool in nitrogen ﬂow. The as-produced SWNTs were pu-riﬁed using hydrochloric acid solution. Their diameters werefound to range between 0.8 and 1.2 nm, as previouslyshown.\\n31\\nTEM images were collected on a ﬁeld emission JEM-2100F\\ntransmission electron microscopy (JEOL Inc.) equipped with aCCD camera. The acceleration voltage was 100 kV for the Ganalysis. The G nanosheets and the nanotube samples were ho-mogeneously dispersed in 2-propanol under ultrasonication for30 min. Next, a few drops of the suspension were deposited onthe TEM grid, dried, and evacuated before analysis.\\nFigure 4.

The dis-\\npersed graphene was found to have a thickness ranging from 1.2\\nto 5.0 nm with areas up to 40 000 nm2. In contrast, GO had\\nthicknesses ranging from 0.5 to 2.0 nm and areas up to200 000 nm2. However, in both cases more than 90% of the\\nflakes had areas less than 25 000 nm2.\\nGross examination of para ﬃn embedded lung blocks from\\nmice treated 24 h earlier showed a more homogeneous distribu-tion pattern in mice treated with the Pluronic dispersed graphene\\ncompared with the aggregated graphene. In lung sections from\\nanimals treated with Pluronic-dispersed graphene, we observedlung macrophages with a homogeneous black cytoplasm\\nthroughout the lung, which were not observed in vehicle treated\\nanimals (Figure 2a /C0e). In mice treated with graphene aggregates\\nsuspended in saline, we observed the aggregates in medium sized\\nairways surrounded by macrophages with a homogeneous black\\ncytoplasm (Figure 2a /C0e). To quantify the di ﬀerences in the\\ndistribution of the dispersed and aggregated graphene in thelung, we counted the number of randomly chosen 600 /C2ﬁelds\\ncontaining macrophages with black cytoplasm. In mice treated\\nwith nanoscale dispersed graphene, 91 (4% of the high powered\\n(600/C2)ﬁelds contained macrophages with a black cytoplasm\\ncompared with 36 (1% in the mice treated with graphene\\naggregates. These results suggest that nanoscale dispersion ofgraphene improves its distribution in the lung after airway\\ninstillation.\\nIn mice treated 24 h earlier with nanoscale dispersed or\\naggregated graphene, we found minimal histologic evidence oflung in ﬂammation (Figure 2b /C0f). In marked contrast, we ob-\\nserved severe lung in ﬂammation with alveolar exudates and hyaline\\nmembrane formation in mice treated with GO (Figure 2a /C0e).

If homeostasis isnot achieved, cellular macromolecules, such as proteins, DNA,and lipids, can be damaged.\\n2\\nCell membrane damage through physical interaction with\\ngraphenes possessing sharp edges is another possible mechanismof toxicity.68,73Furthermore, due to its hydrophobic surface,\\ngraphene can signi ﬁcantly interact with cell membrane lipids,\\ncausing toxicity.2\\nBacterial cells interacting with GO and rGO exhibited toxicity,\\nwhich may be due to the loss of membrane integrity, and theproposed toxicity mechanism includes initial cell deposition ongraphene-based materials and membrane stress caused by directcontact with sharp nanosheets.\\n17Gurunathan et al.90previously\\ndem', name='Seabra2013 pages 6-6', doc=Doc(docname='Seabra2013', citation='Seabra, Amedea B., et al. \"Nanotoxicity of Graphene and Graphene Oxide.\" ACS Nano, vol. 7, no. 10, 2013, pp. 8191-8207.', dockey='51e13c001756189cac875d9e59a3ca22'), embeddings=None) score=10\n",

Additionally, at exposure times longer than 48 hours, all tested GO concentrations (5-50 mg/L) caused significant increases in SOD activity. Furthermore, peroxidative damage, indicated by elevated levels of lipid peroxidation (LPO), was only found in samples treated with the highest GO concentration (50 mg/L) for ≥48 hours (Lv2018 lines 1123-1127). Therefore, it can be concluded that the outcome of GO inducing oxidative stress in biological systems occurred at concentrations of ≥20 mg/L after 24 hours of exposure and at all tested concentrations (5-50 mg/L) after 48 hours of exposure."

GO is produced by exfoliating graphite oxide and has various chemical and electronic properties. The oxygen-derived functional groups on the GO sheet allow it to react with organic and inorganic chemicals, leading to the synthesis of functional hybrids and complexes. The coverage of oxygen groups on GO varies depending on the degree of oxidation. The most widely accepted structural model of GO suggests that the functional groups on the basal plane consist primarily of hydroxyl and epoxy groups, with only small quantities of carboxyl groups at the edge. Recent experiments suggest that the peripheral carboxyl groups play a key role in determining the solution behavior of GO. The pH-dependent hydrophilicity of GO is attributed to the ionized carboxyl groups. \\\\n\\\\nRelevance score: 10/10\\\\n\\\\nYang2013 lines 0-1: The text discusses a study on the in vivo biodistribution and toxicology of functionalized nano-graphene oxide (GO) in mice after oral and intraperitoneal administration.

INTRODUCTION\\\\nIn recent years, as an alternative approach to producing\\\\ngraphene on a large scale,1/C03the exfoliation of graphite oxide\\\\nhas triggered considerable research e \\\\ufb00orts aimed at demonstrat-\\\\ning its chemical and electronic properties.4,5The resulting thin\\\\ngraphene oxide (GO) sheets can be easily dispersed in an\\\\naqueous medium without adding amphiphilic stabilizers, includ-ing subsequently carrying out the necessary solution-phasechemistry. The oxygen-derived functional groups on the sheet\\\\nbasal plane and sheet edge allows GO to be reactive with organic\\\\nand inorganic chemicals such that a rich variety of functionalhybrids and complexes can be synthesized.\\\\n4,5In addition, the\\\\nmolecular orbital change of sp3to sp2carbons through reduction\\\\nchemistry can restore the graphene lattice to some extent.6,7\\\\nFurthermore, the tunable conductivity and electronic band gap\\\\nprovide a controllable route to transforming an insulator to a\\\\ngraphenelike semimetal.5Because of these interesting GO prop-\\\\nerties, a broad spectrum of potential applications ranging fromprintable electronics and solar cells to biosensors have been\\\\nproposed. To control the processes of exfoliation, dispersion,\\\\nfunctionalization, and self-assembly8of the suspended GO sheets\\\\nin aqueous media, a fundamental understanding of their solution\\\\nbehavior is in order.4\\\\nThe chemical structure of GO is heterogeneous, and the\\\\ncoverage of oxygen groups varies depending on the degree of\\\\noxidation in the preparation processes.4To date, the most widely\\\\naccepted structural model of GO is based on a series of analysesperformed by Lerf and Klinowski.9These analyses indicated that\\\\nthe functional groups on the basal plane of the GO sheet consistsprimarily of hydroxyl and epoxy groups and that only small\\\\nquantities of carboxyl groups are present at the edge of the GO\\\\nsheets.9Considering the excellent ability of water to disperse\\\\nGO, this material was initially assumed to be hydrophilic, withthe hydrophilicity resulting from the hydroxyl and epoxy groupspresent in the GO sheet basal plane.\\\\n1However, recent experi-\\\\nments involving pH changes and salt addition suggest that the\\\\nperipheral carboxyl groups actually play a key role in determiningthe solution behavior of GO.10The colloidal stability of aqueous\\\\nGO solutions has been attributed to the electrostatic repulsions\\\\nbetween ionized carboxyl groups.10The pH-dependent hydro-\\\\nphilicity of GO has been exploited to c\", \"name\": \"Shih2012 pages 1-1\", \"doc\": {\"docname\": \"Shih2012\", \"citation\": \"Shih, Chih-Jen, et al. \\\\\"Understanding the pH-Dependent Behavior of Graphene Oxide Aqueous Solutions: A Comparative Experimental and Molecular Dynamics Simulation Study.\\\\\" Langmuir, vol. 28, 2012, pp. 235-241. doi:10.1021/la203607w.\", \"dockey\": \"66563f51f3bdb59e38fa9916ff4e7172\"}, \"embeddings\": null}, \"score\": 10}, {\"context\": \"The text discusses a study on the in vivo biodistribution and toxicology of functionalized nano-graphene oxide (GO) in mice after oral and intraperitoneal administration.

TOXICITY MECHANISMS\\\\nAlthough the mechanisms responsible for graphene and GOtoxicity have been discussed previously,51no conclusions have\\\\nbeen drawn that are su \\\\ufb03cient to establish risk assessments or\\\\nregulations.89Graphene is a unique nanomaterial compared withspherical nanoparticles and one-dimensional nanotubes due to\\\\nits two-dimensional structure.\\\\nMany reports have proposed that oxidative stress is one\\\\nof the mechanisms involved in the toxic e \\\\ufb00ects of carbon nano-\\\\nmaterials.2,24,37,90The oxidative stress in target cells is caused by\\\\nthe generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS).2Antioxidant\\\\nenzymes, such as superoxide dismutase or glutathione per-oxidase, are able to reduce and eliminate ROS. If homeostasis isnot achieved, cellular macromolecules, such as proteins, DNA,and lipids, can be damaged.\\\\n2\\\\nCell membrane damage through physical interaction with\\\\ngraphenes possessing sharp edges is another possible mechanismof toxicity.68,73Furthermore, due to its hydrophobic surface,\\\\ngraphene can signi \\\\ufb01cantly interact with cell membrane lipids,\\\\ncausing toxicity.2\\\\nBacterial cells interacting with GO and rGO exhibited toxicity,\\\\nwhich may be due to the loss of membrane integrity, and theproposed toxicity mechanism includes initial cell deposition ongraphene-based materials and membrane stress caused by directcontact with sharp nanosheets.\\\\n17Gurunathan et al.90previously\\\\ndem\", \"name\": \"Seabra2013 pages 6-6\", \"doc\": {\"docname\": \"Seabra2013\", \"citation\": \"Seabra, Amedea B., et al. \\\\\"Nanotoxicity of Graphene and Graphene Oxide.\\\\\" ACS Nano, vol. 7, no. 10, 2013, pp. 8191-8207.\", \"dockey\": \"51e13c001756189cac875d9e59a3ca22\"}, \"embeddings\": null}, \"score\": 5}, {\"context\": \"The text discusses the behavior of graphene oxide (GO) upon exposure to surface functionalization.

INTRODUCTION\\nIn recent years, as an alternative approach to producing\\ngraphene on a large scale,1/C03the exfoliation of graphite oxide\\nhas triggered considerable research e ﬀorts aimed at demonstrat-\\ning its chemical and electronic properties.4,5The resulting thin\\ngraphene oxide (GO) sheets can be easily dispersed in an\\naqueous medium without adding amphiphilic stabilizers, includ-ing subsequently carrying out the necessary solution-phasechemistry. The oxygen-derived functional groups on the sheet\\nbasal plane and sheet edge allows GO to be reactive with organic\\nand inorganic chemicals such that a rich variety of functionalhybrids and complexes can be synthesized.\\n4,5In addition, the\\nmolecular orbital change of sp3to sp2carbons through reduction\\nchemistry can restore the graphene lattice to some extent.6,7\\nFurthermore, the tunable conductivity and electronic band gap\\nprovide a controllable route to transforming an insulator to a\\ngraphenelike semimetal.5Because of these interesting GO prop-\\nerties, a broad spectrum of potential applications ranging fromprintable electronics and solar cells to biosensors have been\\nproposed. To control the processes of exfoliation, dispersion,\\nfunctionalization, and self-assembly8of the suspended GO sheets\\nin aqueous media, a fundamental understanding of their solution\\nbehavior is in order.4\\nThe chemical structure of GO is heterogeneous, and the\\ncoverage of oxygen groups varies depending on the degree of\\noxidation in the preparation processes.4To date, the most widely\\naccepted structural model of GO is based on a series of analysesperformed by Lerf and Klinowski.9These analyses indicated that\\nthe functional groups on the basal plane of the GO sheet consistsprimarily of hydroxyl and epoxy groups and that only small\\nquantities of carboxyl groups are present at the edge of the GO\\nsheets.9Considering the excellent ability of water to disperse\\nGO, this material was initially assumed to be hydrophilic, withthe hydrophilicity resulting from the hydroxyl and epoxy groupspresent in the GO sheet basal plane.\\n1However, recent experi-\\nments involving pH changes and salt addition suggest that the\\nperipheral carboxyl groups actually play a key role in determiningthe solution behavior of GO.10The colloidal stability of aqueous\\nGO solutions has been attributed to the electrostatic repulsions\\nbetween ionized carboxyl groups.10The pH-dependent hydro-\\nphilicity of GO has been exploited to c',\n",

The dis-\\npersed graphene was found to have a thickness ranging from 1.2\\nto 5.0 nm with areas up to 40 000 nm2. In contrast, GO had\\nthicknesses ranging from 0.5 to 2.0 nm and areas up to200 000 nm2. However, in both cases more than 90% of the\\nflakes had areas less than 25 000 nm2.\\nGross examination of para ﬃn embedded lung blocks from\\nmice treated 24 h earlier showed a more homogeneous distribu-tion pattern in mice treated with the Pluronic dispersed graphene\\ncompared with the aggregated graphene. In lung sections from\\nanimals treated with Pluronic-dispersed graphene, we observedlung macrophages with a homogeneous black cytoplasm\\nthroughout the lung, which were not observed in vehicle treated\\nanimals (Figure 2a /C0e). In mice treated with graphene aggregates\\nsuspended in saline, we observed the aggregates in medium sized\\nairways surrounded by macrophages with a homogeneous black\\ncytoplasm (Figure 2a /C0e). To quantify the di ﬀerences in the\\ndistribution of the dispersed and aggregated graphene in thelung, we counted the number of randomly chosen 600 /C2ﬁelds\\ncontaining macrophages with black cytoplasm.

It mentions that the addition of GO and SiO2 nanoparticles to a fluid increased its viscosity. The text also discusses the creation of biocompatible and antibacterial nanocomposites by combining dialdehyde cellulose (DAC) with S-containing amino acids in the presence of GO. Experimental and computational data suggest that the interaction of DAC with amino acids improves their reactivity and interaction. Additionally, the text mentions the use of MD simulations to study the separation of H2O/O2 gas molecules over a double-layered nanoporous GO membrane in the presence of an electric field. The presence of the electric field inhibits hydrogen bond interactions and allows for improved H2O/O2 separation. The reduction of GO using nanosecond infrared laser irradiation is also discussed, where rapid heating results in GO transformation into reduced graphene oxide (rGO). \\n\\nScore: 8',\n",

On the basis of root morphology studies, the authorssuggested that plant cell death induced by graphene treatmentmight occur either by apoptosis or by necrosis. These factsindicate that the potential toxic e ﬀect of graphenes on plants may\\nlargely depend on the graphene dose, exposure time, and theplant species. Therefore, this topic deserves further attention.\\n86\\nTo assess physiological responses, such as biomass accumu-\\nlation, few-layer graphene materials were introduced intoMurashige and Skoog (MS) media (50 μg/mL) along with\\ntomato seeds with a sterilized surface, and the germination andgrowth were followed.\\n87The authors observed that few-layer\\ngraphene carbon structures did not signi ﬁcantly a ﬀect plant\\ngrowth rates, most likely because of their inability to penetrateplant tissues.\\nShort-term and high-load e ﬀects of GO on microbial functions\\nrelated to biological wastewater treatment processes showedtoxic e ﬀects on microbial communities in a dose-dependent\\nmanner, especially in concentrations greater than 50 mg/L.Many biological activities were signi ﬁcantly impacted by the\\npresence of GO in an activated sludge. The authors suggestedthat the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) could beone of the responsible mechanisms for the toxic e ﬀect of GO.\\n88\\nIn this sense, graphene is a promising material for environ-\\nmental applications, and its phytotoxicity should be furtherinvestigated.6\\n6. TOXICITY MECHANISMS\\nAlthough the mechanisms responsible for graphene and GOtoxicity have been discussed previously,51no conclusions have\\nbeen drawn that are su ﬃcient to establish risk assessments or\\nregulations.89Graphene is a unique nanomaterial compared withspherical nanoparticles and one-dimensional nanotubes due to\\nits two-dimensional structure.\\nMany reports have proposed that oxidative stress is one\\nof the mechanisms involved in the toxic e ﬀects of carbon nano-\\nmaterials.2,24,37,90The oxidative stress in target cells is caused by\\nthe generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS).2Antioxidant\\nenzymes, such as superoxide dismutase or glutathione per-oxidase, are able to reduce and eliminate ROS. If homeostasis isnot achieved, cellular macromolecules, such as proteins, DNA,and lipids, can be damaged.\\n2\\nCell membrane damage through physical interaction with\\ngraphenes possessing sharp edges is another possible mechanismof toxicity.68,73Furthermore, due to its hydrophobic surface,\\ngraphene can signi ﬁcantly interact with cell membrane lipids,\\ncausing toxicity.2\\nBacterial cells interacting with GO and rGO exhibited toxicity,\\nwhich may be due to the loss of membrane integrity, and theproposed toxicity mechanism includes initial cell deposition ongraphene-based materials and membrane stress caused by directcontact with sharp nanosheets.\\n17Gurunathan et al.90previously\\ndem',\n",

However, the biological behavior of these nanosheets,especially their interactions with cells, is not well understood. Here,we report our findings about the cell surface adhesion, subcellularlocations, and size-dependent uptake mechanisms of protein-coatedgraphene oxide nanosheets (PCGO). Small nanosheets enter cellsmainly through clathrin-mediated endocytosis, and the increase ofgraphene size enhances phagocytotic uptake of the nanosheets. Thesefindings will facilitate biomedical and toxicologic studies of graphenesand provide fundamental understanding of interactions at theinterface of two-dimensional nanostructures and biological systems.\\nKEYWORDS: graphene oxide nanosheets, protein binding, cell uptake, clathrin-mediated endocytosis, phagocytosis, size dependence\\n■INTRODUCTION\\nGraphene, a hexagonal carbon nanostructure similar to carbon\\nnanotubes and fullerene, has unique electronic, thermal, andmechanical properties, showing tremendous application\\npotential in fields such as electronics and biomedicine.\\n1,2\\nGraphene oxide (GO), which is oxidized graphite withenhanced aqueous solubility, has been proven to be an efficient\\nbiosensor,\\n3drug carrier,4,5and photothermal cancer-killing\\nagent.6,7GO nanosheets are able to enter cells which renders\\nthem to become promising candidates for intracellular deliveryof drugs and cellular imaging.

       " 'formatted_answer': 'Question: How does surface functionalization affect the behavior of graphene oxide upon exposure?\\n\\nSurface functionalization of graphene oxide (GO) can significantly affect its behavior upon exposure. Different surface chemical modifications, such as oxidation, reduction, carboxylation, amination, and polymer modification, can alter the physicochemical properties of GO and its interaction with biological systems (Ma2020; Matesanz2013). Surface functionalization can affect the oxygen content, O/C ratio, zeta potential, and colloidal stability of GO, leading to changes in its aggregation behavior and biodistribution (Dependence2021; Yang2013). It can also influence the interaction mechanisms at the nano-bio interface, such as protein corona formation, cell membrane damage, membrane receptor interaction, and oxidative stress (Ma2020). Additionally, surface functionalization can impact the cytotoxicity, ROS generation, and conformational changes induced by GO exposure (An2023). Overall, surface functionalization plays a crucial role in modulating the behavior and biological effects of GO upon exposure.\\n',\n",
